# Burn Intermediate Representation

Defines an Intermediate Representation (IR) used to represent tensors and operations.

The abstraction over computation allows execution across different targets (e.g., remote backend).
It also enables optimization and transformation of tensor computations before execution (e.g.,
operator fusion).
